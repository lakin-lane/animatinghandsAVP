# Animating hand models in visionOS

Substitute a person’s hands with custom models in a fully immersive space.

Hand tracking enables your app to observe an Apple Vision Pro wearer’s hand positions and joint rotations in real-time within an immersive space. This sample code project demonstrates how to replace the wearer’s hands with animated glove models in a fully immersive space.
For more information about the app and how it works, see [Animating hand models in visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/animating-hand-models-in-visionOS) in the developer documentation.
